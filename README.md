# moheim-map

An interactive map of the Moheim server in Valheim, built from screenshots and crowdsourced data.

You can see it [here](https://timhugh.github.io/moheim-map)!

# How?

The screenshots are all digitized in QGIS.
Currently using [qgis2web](https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web) to create all the files in this repository. I'd like too figure out a good export flow to use raster tiles so I can just use all of the styling already applied in QGIS but that's a problem for later!
